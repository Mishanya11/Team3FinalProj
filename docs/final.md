The problem our team tried to identify is the saftey of the people of Prince Georges County. We tried to do so by accessing police records of crime incidents that have happened in Prince Georges County since 2017. With the use of this data set we hoped to make this information readily accessable for the citicens of PG County to increase their knowledge about crime in select areas. We incorperated a search feature that shows all of the incidents that have occured matching the criteria of either Date or Type of crime. With the date filter we hope individuals can gain further insight on the changes that occur to certain areas over time. Addionally, we were working on a heatmap that would depict these points with their geopositional tags that each incident posses. Unfourtunalty, we were unable to get this funtionality working however we believe that it would help further depict certain unsafe areas which the user could pick up much quicker looking at a map as oppsoed to searching through adresses. In the future we feel that it is neccessary to incorperate the heatmap functionality correctly to give the users a more refined interface to recieve their information from.
